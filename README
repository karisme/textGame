This is the first time I make commits from a bash terminal, attempt to familiarize myself with git in the command line.
This is a classic game where the character is controlled by choosing the available options that appear in the command line.

Will eventually make the text appear to be written slowly on the terminal like the old mission impossible mission briefs (Typewrite effect with sound)
Ideas:
-Make a maze to evade attackers at one point (use help from other projects)
-Flesh out story (betrayal, different endings)


Let's Go!
